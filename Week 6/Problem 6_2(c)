The Heap Sort variant from subpoint(b) has a better time complexity for all casse(worst-case,avarage-case and best-case) than the
original variant. The variant from subpoint(b) is better because it takes into consideration when an element that was swapped to become
the new root is typically small and thus would float down to a leaf level in most cases so it saves time in different scenario.
