Insertion Sort - This is a stable sorting algorithm. It checks through out the list, taking the next element and inserting it
into the sorted portion of the list. When elements with equal values are encountered, Insertion Sort does not change their 
order. It always inserts the new element after all elements with the same values that gives the algorithm stabilty.

Merge Sort - This is also a stable sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the list into smaller sublists, sorting 
them, and then merging them back together sorted. When combining two sorted sublists into one sorted list, it always takes 
the  order of equal elements from the original lists. Therefore, it maintains stability.

Heap Sort - This is not a stable sorting algorithm. It involves building a heap from the input list and then is removing the
maximum element from the heap and it is placing it at the end of the list. This involves swapping elements which leads to instability.

Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort is a stable sorting algorithm. It compares elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order of sorting. 
When two elements with equal values are compared, no swap occurs, ensuring that their order is maintained. 
Therefore, Bubble Sort maintains stability.
