A greedy algorithm picks up the maximum number at each step hoping to find an optimal solution by "Guessing" the right solution. This type of algorithm would not work in this case because it does not consider all cases and future cases. If the triangle has a larger number of elements then the sum would not be correctly calculated and a specific dynamic way of analysing all the possible cases.S`
