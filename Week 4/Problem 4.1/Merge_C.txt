For best case time complexity:
    For small k values, the best-case time complexity remains O(n log n),as most work is done by merging.
    For large k values, the perfomance might degrease beacuse of the insertion sort overhead.

For average case time complexity:
    For small k values, the average-case time complexity will slightliy worsen beacuse of the Insertion Sort overhead.
    For large k values, the average-case complexity might approach 0(n logn).

For worst case time complexity:
    For small k, the worst-case time complexity will decrease to O(n^2) bgeacuse of the Insertion Sort.
    For larker k, the worst-case values will improve, approaching O(n logn).
